          <p>Juliana Zepka is a French-Brazilian artist. She lives and works in Paris.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Her work explores the spectral and memorial dimensions of the image and the archive in the context of their policies of reproduction, digitalisation and restitution. In 2022, after finishing her degree at the Sandberg Institute (Amsterdam), she wrote a manifesto on the anarchive as keystone of her artistic research: the study of the archive through its blank pages, through the invisible, the fictional, the anonymous, the forgotten. She also works on request to create visual content (graphics, web design, video) for artists, cultural institutions and associations.</p>

              <p><i>Come as you are (News from Absurdistan)</i> is an installation made up of five cardboard boxes covered with collages combining archive images and screenshots of publications from the satirical Facebook page 'News From Absurdistan'. The selected Facebook publications, reporting real but absurd events, are set against images of digitised newspaper cuttings. The dialogue created by merging these different sources of information tends to blur both the context and the very origin of the information and creates an alternative, hybrid meaning. The series aims to highlight the excesses and simplification of media consumption habits in a context of fragmented information and post-truth.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The shape of the objects is based on the emblematic Happy Meal box, marketed by fast food giant McDonald's since 1979, as a symbol of the link between mass consumption and pop culture when these are linked to a process of abundance. The title <i>Come As You Are</i> was inspired by the eponymous track from counter-culture band Nirvana's album <i>Nevermind</i> (1991), which was subsequently re-appropriated by McDonalds as a marketing slogan in 2008.</p>
